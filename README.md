# Chemical Supplies Management

This project is a web-based application for managing chemical supplies data. It provides a table that displays chemical information such as chemical name, vendor, density, viscosity, packaging, and more. Users can perform actions like sorting the table, adding new chemicals, editing the existing data, and deleting or swapping rows. The project adheres to the guidelines provided and uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **plain JavaScript** without any frameworks.

## Features

- **Dynamic Table with Sortable Columns**: Users can sort the table data in ascending or descending order by clicking on the arrow buttons on each column header.
- **Add New Chemical**: Users can add new chemical entries using the modal form.
- **Edit Functionality**: The table allows inline editing of the density, viscosity, pack size, and quantity fields.
- **Row Operations**: Users can move rows up or down, delete rows, and swap rows.
- **Reset Table**: Reset the table to its original state using the reset button.
- **Modal for Adding Rows**: The modal form is used to add new entries, ensuring that all fields are filled before submission.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- A local or online static server to serve the HTML page (e.g., you can use `live-server` or any HTTP server).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YashK21/IITB-Assignmen.git
2. **Start the server by navigating to the project directory and running the server.
3. **Alternatively, open index.html directly in a web browser (though sorting features might require a server to fetch data).
